Terraform is an automation tool for provisioning and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It simplifies management and orchestration of cloud, and it helps DevOps teams build large-scale, multi-cloud infrastructure. Terraform is a declarative orchestration tool that supports immutability and idempotency. 

I have being working with Terraform at my workplace for a while. I recently challenged myself to delve deeper into other areas of Terraform that I wasn't very familiar with by creating numerous hands-on labs, most of which was done on the Raspberry Pi (but that's another blog post). The next challenge was to assess my skill; and what's a better way to verify my skills and competencies in Infrastructure as Code automation, using Terraform other than taking taking the Terraform Associate exam?  I decided to give a shot. The exam fee is affordable and there can only be one of two outcomes afterrall –– a pass or fail. There is nothing to lose, but a badge to gain.
  
According to HashipCorp, "Earners of the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate certification know the basic concepts, skills, and use cases associated with open source HashiCorp Terraform. They understand and can utilize Terraform according to the certification objectives. Additionally, they understand why enterprises choose to extend Terraform Open Source with Terraform Enterprise to solve business critical objectives".


Terraform, as well as the <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate"> Terraform Certification </a> is gaining lots of popularity (at least in my network), and to help folks acquire this shiny badge, I thought I would share what I did to prepare for the exam.  Whilst I cannot share the exam questions for obvious reasons, I can give you tips on how to ace the exam.

## Begin from the familiar

Given the inherent complexity of cloud and/or hybrid infrastructure, introducing new concepts like Terraform may add some steep learning challenge, especially given that Terraform uses a custom domain-specific-language (DSL), the tip however, is to begin with the familiar and walk you way into the unknown.

Chances are you have some level familiarity with an infrastructure automation or orchestration tool, such as Kubernetes, AWS CloudFormation, GCP Deployment Manager, Azure Resource Manager or even Ansible. My recommendation is to start from any of the familiar point. In my case, I have done a fair amount of work on infra as code and monitoring with Ansible and Kubernetes, so I began by converting some my existing Kubernetes manifests and Ansible tasks into [HashiCorp COnfiguration Language (HCL)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html), doing that gave me a lot of appreciation for Terraform. The code is a lot cleaner, Terraform modules give users the ability to write once and re-use code, and being a able to generate a full execution plan and dependency  maps & graphs in the DOT format - (https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) is simply amazing!!!

 Now being a `kubectl` fan, I wondered why some companies would prefer Terraform to `kubectl` –– to manage Kubernetes workload, but I am convinced now that I have seen the beauty of this tool. Big up to HashiCorp.

 In summary, get your hands real dirty with Terraform Configurations - start with monolith configurations, then convert into modules. Try calling a child module from a parent with variables, and accessing child module outputs from the calling module. 
## The Exam

While the exam is not as deep as a hands-on exam (because it's Associate level exam), it certainly challenges ones understanding of basic concepts and operations. 
I thought questions were approachable, although it may be because I have used Terraform for a while, or I’m comparing it to the Kubernetes Certified Associate exam which I also recently passed. The CKAD exam is intense.

Further, the exam questions are a combination of true/false, multiple choice, and multi-select questions. It is an online proctored exam, and you are expected to answer to attempt 57 questions in 60 minutes. The overall result is presented to you instantly.  Please refer to the <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate"> exam details page </a> for further details on the objectives.

## Study Materials

-  <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-study"> Study Guide </a>:  I followed the study guide religiously whilst taking notes and testing out most of the commands on the terminal (where applicable). 

-  <a href= "https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/" target="_blank"> Terraform: Up & Running </a> :   This book was of immense help to me when I started learning Terraform. It also provided further elightenment on DevOps and Infra as code in general. 

- <a href= "https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-prep-course/" target="_blank"> HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate Prep Course 2020  </a> This an Udemy course by Warp 9 Training. Dude is straight to-the-point and it is a very good use of my 3 hours. There are some courses on Terraform that is about 10 - 14 hours long, I honestly, don't have that much time to commit. Warp 9's course is concise and very informative. 

 <a href= "https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-practice-exam/" target="_blank"> Udemy Practice Exam by Bryan Krausen </a> : Test your knowledge of HashiCorp Terraform with questions designed to ensure you're comfortable with a wide variety of Terraform topics.

## Summary
I can tell you from personal experience that Terraform’s popularity has skyrocketed. The launch of a formal certification for Terraform is a major milestone for HashiCorp, and I suspect the cert will be incredibly popular. The good news is that the exam was created with fairness and transparency in mind. What you see in the objectives is what you get in the exam. Between the resources above and practice time with the Terraform itself, I think you will be well positioned to pass the exam and achieve the Terraform Associate certification. Good luck, and let me know how you do!
