Terraform is a declarative orchestration tool for provisioning and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It simplifies management and orchestration of cloud, and it helps DevOps/SRE teams to build large-scale, multi-cloud (immutable) infrastructure.

I have been working with Terraform at my workplace for a while. Over the last few months, I delved deeper into other Terraform areas that I wasn't very familiar with by creating numerous container orchestration hands-on labs. These labs were mostly executed against the Raspberry Pi (but that's another blog post). The next challenge was to assess my skill; and what's a better way to verify my skills and competencies in Infrastructure as Code automation using Terraform other than taking the Terraform certification exam? There can only be one of two outcomes –– a pass or fail. There is nothing to lose but a chance to add to the <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/users/israelo/badges" target="_blank"> badge collection </a>. I gave it a shot!

Terraform is gaining lots of popularity in the industry. These notes summarise what you should expect if you’re preparing for the exam. Whilst I cannot share the exam questions for obvious reasons, I can give you tips on how to add the shiny badge to your collection.
## Begin from the familiar

Given the inherent complexity of cloud (and hybrid) infrastructure, introducing new concepts like Terraform may add some steep learning curve, especially given that Terraform uses a custom domain-specific-language (DSL). To stay focused and motivated, I'd recommend you start your learning path from a familiar tool, tinker project... find a reference point. Chances are you have some level of familiarity with infrastructure automation or orchestration tool(s) like Kubernetes, AWS CloudFormation, GCP Deployment Manager, Azure Resource Manager or even Ansible. My recommendation is to start from something you know, or have built. In my case, I have done a fair amount of work on infrastructure automation using  Ansible and Kubernetes. I began by converting some of my existing Kubernetes manifests and Ansible tasks into the [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html), doing that gave me a lot of appreciation for Terraform. The code is a lot cleaner; Terraform modules allow users to write once and share modules. Terraform abstracts idempotency for users, and it generates a full execution plan and dependency maps which you can export into <a href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html"> graphviz </a> in DOT format - to aid further analysis. Unlike most of the online tutorials that uses AWS, I chose to use Kubernetes and Ansible to learn Terraform because they were my reference points. Starting from the familiar will help you relate to past pain points and appreciate Terraform's workflow.

 Now being a `kubectl` fan, I wondered why some of my customers would prefer using Terraform to manage Kubernetes workload in their CI/CD pipeline instead of `kubectl`, but I am convinced now that I have seen the beauty of this tool. Big up to HashiCorp.

 In summary, get your hands really dirty with Terraform Configurations - you may start by creating monolith configurations, then convert them into modules modules. Try calling a child module from a parent with variables, and try accessing child module outputs from the calling module.
## The Exam

While the exam is not as tough as other exams in the related field, it certainly challenges ones understanding of basic concepts and operations, although my assesement is probably because I cannot help but compare to to the Kubernetes Certified Associate exam which I also recently passed. The CKAD exam was intense and I wrote a <a href="https://www.israelo.io/blog/ckad-prep-guide" target="_blank">prep note here</a>.

Further, the exam questions are a combination of true/false, multiple choice, and multi-select questions. It is an online proctored exam, and you are expected to answer to attempt 57 questions in 60 minutes. The overall result is presented to you instantly.  Please refer to the <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate"> exam details page </a> for further details on the objectives.

## Study Materials

-  <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-study"> Study Guide </a>:  I followed the study guide religiously whilst taking notes and testing out most of the commands on the terminal (where applicable). 

-  <a href= "https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/" target="_blank"> Terraform: Up & Running </a> :   This book was of immense help to me when I started learning Terraform. It also provided further elightenment on DevOps and Infra as code in general. 

- <a href= "https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-prep-course/" target="_blank"> HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate Prep Course 2020  </a> This an Udemy course by Warp 9 Training. Dude is straight to-the-point and it is a very good use of my 3 hours. There are some courses on Terraform that is about 10 - 14 hours long, I honestly, don't have that much time to commit. Warp 9's course is concise and very informative. 

 <a href= "https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-practice-exam/" target="_blank"> Udemy Practice Exam by Bryan Krausen </a> : Test your knowledge of HashiCorp Terraform with questions designed to ensure you're comfortable with a wide variety of Terraform topics.

## Summary
I can tell you from personal experience that Terraform’s popularity has skyrocketed. The launch of a formal certification for Terraform is a major milestone for HashiCorp, and I suspect the cert will be incredibly popular. The good news is that the exam was created with fairness and transparency in mind. What you see in the objectives is what you get in the exam. Between the resources above and practice time with the Terraform itself, I think you will be well positioned to pass the exam and achieve the Terraform Associate certification. Good luck, and let me know how you do!

Good luck and stay hungry
