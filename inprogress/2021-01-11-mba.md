I was admitted into a PhD program as soon as I graduated from an M.Sc program at Middlesex University, London. Shortly after I enrolled in the PhD program, LIFE offered me a choice between the PhD and starting a family. Being my stubborn self, I decided to take on both for a while, but it was quite a struggle, it just didn't work so I caved in and made the PhD the opportunity cost. I had dreamt and planned to become a Dr. before I turn 30 for so long - I had it within my grip, but I had to let go. It was not an easy decision at the time, but looking back, it was undoubtedly the right choice, no regrets whatsoever.

Nine years later, I felt like it was time to go back to the classroom again. I considered two options: a PhD or an MBA. Guess what? I made the PhD the opportunity cost yet again. It may be a third time lucky, you never know.

But the million £ question is, why should a techie like me care about studying a Masters of Business Administration anyways? 

These are my reasons:

## Why MBA ? 

I have always known I wanted to pursue an MBA as I lacked skills—particularly the quantitative skills—I knew the MBA would provide. However, pursuing an MBA became urgent about a year ago. I distinctly remember working with a colleague before he went to business school and working with him soon after he finished school and returned to Deloitte. I was astounded by his growth as a professional. I was also embarrassed because he was running circles around me. That experience was a catalyst in my pursuit of an MBA as I realized: (1) I didn’t have a spouse or children so there were no real family considerations; (2) my company offered a sponsorship program; and (3) I was getting older so if I didn’t do it now I would never do it.”

Pursuing an MBA affords me the opportunity to become better-versed in the language of data analytics, acquire formal skills in operations management, and take the time necessary to become better at the art of networking, while learning the nuances of a culture outside of the military


The opportunity to pursue an MBA now presents a unique opportunity to expand my skillset to focus on areas that are most relevant for a business world that will become increasingly more global and technologically advanced.”



The high-level road mapping and brainstorming activities really engaged my creative thinking and I looked for opportunities to ask questions like “Who is the target customer and what is the problem we are trying to solve?”, “What are the key features that add value to the customer?”, and “What are the critical milestones in the development process and how will we measure success at each milestone?”.

However, I saw a gap in my education and the development process as a whole: it was not being driven by strategic business objectives. At this point, I knew the MBA could offer two critical benefits to me: (1) I would gain the fundamental business skills needed to bring strategic leadership and insight to the product development process; and (2) I could immersive myself in learning other aspects of product management, such as marketing and analytics, and pivot my career to better align with my creative goals.”


 1. An MBA teaches you important business and analytical skills

## Selecting a Business School 

There are some key factors that must be considered before studying an MBA, and except you are being sponsored your choice is even more limited, let's consider some of my variables: 

1. Budget 
2. Accreditation 

Accreditation from a reputable organization is one good way to check the quality of a business school. Accreditation organizations evaluate the quality standards of a business school's teaching, faculty, services, and students, among other things.

The three most-coveted, international accreditations for MBA programs are those awarded by AACSB, AMBA, and EQUIS

2. Course content
3. Mode of study  

But it could be hard..
