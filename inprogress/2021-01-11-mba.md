I was admitted into a PhD program as soon as I graduated from an M.Sc program at Middlesex University, London. Shortly after I enrolled in the full-time PhD program, LIFE gave me an ultimatum — start a family or forfeit the PhD. Being my stubborn self, I decided to take on both responsibilities for a while, but it was quite a struggle, it just didn't work so I caved in and made the PhD the opportunity cost. I had dreamt and planned to become a Dr. before I turn 30 for so long - I had it within my grip, but I had to let go. It was not an easy decision at the time, but looking back, it was undoubtedly the right choice, no regrets whatsoever.

Nine years later, I felt like it was time to go back to the classroom again. I considered two options: a PhD or an MBA. Guess what? I made the PhD the opportunity cost yet again. PhD may be a third time lucky, you never know.

But the million £ questions are, why should a techie like me care about studying a Masters of Business Administration, is it worth the investment, will I ever get the return on my investment - yes, I am self-funding it, and considering that I have a full time job, I am a husband and a father to two lovely girls, where would I find the time to study?  Lots of questions, lots of uncertainties, but I enrolled anyways. 

> I made the PhD the opportunity cost yet again.

## Why MBA ? 

Let me provide some context before I answer the question directly, one of the long term objective in my personal development plan (PDP) is to become a CTO someday. It is for this reason that I left a core Engineering role to become a Consultant and now an Architect. Having a PDP gives me a fulcrum, a yardstick and it determines the type of job, team, mentorship that I gravitate towards.

Being conscious of my limitations, I approached <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jrbronet" target="_blank"> Jose Ramon Bronet </a> to coach me. 

(_There's a subtle difference between a coach and a mentor. Did you know that?  <a href="https://www.kent.edu/yourtrainingpartner/know-difference-between-coaching-and-mentoring#:~:text=Coaching%20is%20more%20performance%20driven,holistic%20approach%20to%20career%20development." target="_blank"> Ref_</a>) 

Jose is a Senior Director at Cisco AppDynamics an he is an all round great leader that I admire a lot. I also know that he is the type that will not sugar coat his feedback. I needed a coach that will lay it bare, I was chuffed, extremely delighted when he agreed.  

We started the coaching session by exploring my personality - learning style, SWOT, MBTI tests etc. We then explored the attributes of a great CTO:  deep technical background, business acumen, strategic thinking, communication skills and customer-centricity bubbled up the chain. Then we began creating development actions using the combination of the key "great CTO" attributes, my personality test results and the identified gaps.

With Jose's help, we both agreed that I would immensely benefit from an MBA. Pursuing an MBA affords me the opportunity to become better-versed in data-driven decision making, I will acquire formal ethical leadership skills, and take the time necessary to become better at the art of networking, communication while learning the nuances of how to protect the book of business. It will also enable me to learn how to define and implement effective strategies.

Simply put, it became apparent that I need to augment my technical skills with business acumen.

## Selecting a Business School 

There are some key factors that must be considered before studying an MBA, and except you are being sponsored your choice is even more limited, let's consider some of my variables: 

1. Budget 
2. Accreditation 

Accreditation from a reputable organization is one good way to check the quality of a business school. Accreditation organizations evaluate the quality standards of a business school's teaching, faculty, services, and students, among other things.

The three most-coveted, international accreditations for MBA programs are those awarded by AACSB, AMBA, and EQUIS

2. Course content
3. Mode of study  

But it could be hard..
