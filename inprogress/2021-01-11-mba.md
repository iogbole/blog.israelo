I was admitted into a PhD program as soon as I graduated from an M.Sc program at Middlesex University, London. Shortly after I enrolled in the PhD program, LIFE offered me a choice between the PhD and starting a family. Being my stubborn self, I decided to take on both for a while, but it was quite a struggle, it just didn't work so I caved in and made the PhD the opportunity cost. I had dreamt and planned to become a Dr. before I turn 30 for so long - I had it within my grip, but I had to let go. It was not an easy decision at the time, but looking back, it was undoubtedly the right choice, no regrets whatsoever.

Nine years later, I felt like it was time to go back to the classroom again. I considered two options: a PhD or an MBA. Guess what? I made the PhD the opportunity cost yet again. It may be a third time lucky, you never know.

But the million £ question is, why should a techie like me care about studying a Masters of Business Administration anyways? 

These are my reasons:

## Why MBA ? 

 1. An MBA teaches you important business and analytical skills

## Selecting a Business School 

There are some key factors that must be considered before studying an MBA, and except you are being sponsored your choice is even more limited, let's consider some of my variables: 

1. Budget 
2. Course content
3. Mode of study  

But it could be hard..
