  Observability
Flow logging: Flow logs at L3-L7 provide deep visibility of forwarding and policy decisions on the network level. A cluster-wide flow query API enables the quick inspection of networking behavior and network drops during incidents.

Programmable Metrics: Configurable and programmable metrics allow users to understand network, application, and security behavior and monitor the correctness consistently.

Service Map: A graphical service topology map simplifies understanding of deployed application topologies and dependencies.

Troubleshooting: The troubleshooting tooling has been built into Cilium from the beginning. An internal tracing system makes it possible to track every forwarding decision and can be enabled on the fly. Metrics capture packet drops with detailed reasoning.

For more details, check out the Functionality Overview in the Cilium documentation.


## Bottom Lines

- eBPF is what JavaScript is to HTML. 
- eBPF can run sandboxed programs in the Linux kernel without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules.
- eBPF is a revolutionary technology because it lets programmers execute custom bytecode within the kernel without having to change the kernel or load kernel modules.
- eBPF is event-driven, i.e. each eBPF program is an event handler. These events are called “hooks”.
- eBPF programs interact with user-space programs via eBPF maps that are key-value pairs.

Update: A new eBPF foundation was <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/facebook-google-isovalent-microsoft-and-netflix-launch-ebpf-foundation-as-part-of-the-linux-foundation/">announced </a> on August 2021, founded by Facebook, Google, Isovalent, Microsoft and Netflix. The new open source <a href="https://www.ebpf.io/">eBPF foundation</a> will be hosted under The Linux Foundation.
