  hero__description: With an MBA in Data Analytics and over eight years of experience in the cloud-native observability field, I have developed a profound understanding and expertise in observability product management and strategy. This platform is dedicated to sharing in-depth insights and knowledge on a range of subjects such as DevOps practices, Cloud-native technologies, and various facets of life. <br>In addition to these topics, I also share the programming journey of my daughter, Naomi, a nine-year-old with a burgeoning passion for coding. Her experiences offer a unique perspective on the early adoption of technology skills. <br>Furthermore, I delve into specialised areas of my expertise, including eBPF, OpenTelemetry, and the integration of Machine Learning with AIOps, aiming to provide a thorough and nuanced perspective on these advanced technological areas.
