My library of reference frameworks is expanding as I progress in my career as a Cloud Observability Product Manager and in my MBA studies. The objective of this post to document the frameworks that I have personally found useful to help me transition into the Product Management career path. 


## Porter 5 Forces

_This one is straright out of business school_.  
Porter's Five Forces is a simple yet effective framework for identifying the primary sources of competition in your industry or sector.
I use this framework to tactically analyse the market, particularly the competition. When you get a good grasp of the forces affecting your product, you'll be able to adjust your strategy, boost your margin, and stay ahead of the competition.

It helps in product strategy and roadmap planning. The five forces are: 

- Threat of New Entry
- Threat of Substitute
- Power of Suppliers
- Power of Buyers
- Market Rivalry

## The AARM Method

The AARM metrics is an analytical framework that defines the metrics for a product/feature. It's an acronumy for : 

- <b>A</b>cquisition — where/what channels do users come from? This is an important consideration during an opportunity scoping exercise. This is also an important metric to track for Product Led Growth strategy.  For instance, entice consumers with a free tier and subsequently convert them to freemium or premium users.
- <b>A</b>>ctivation — What percentange of users used the product after signing up? Did they install an agent? Did users activate their cloud connection, or left it in an incomplete state? 
- <b>R</b>etention - Increasing the frequency with which customers utilise the product/feature. What's the percentage of repeat customers? 
- <b>M</b>onetization - Can you monetise this feature? Why whould anyone pay for this product or feature? Why won't they use an open-source solution instead?

## 5C Analysis

5C Analysis is a marketing framework to analyze the environment in which a company operates. It can provide insight into the key drivers of success, competitive pricing strategy, as well as the risk exposure to various macro environmental factors. The 5Cs are: 

- <b>C</b>ompany  - What is the company's sustainable advantage? 
- <b>Collaborators - This referes to the ecosystem or community that you can build around your product. The Kubernetes ecosystem is a typical example. 
- <b>C</b>ustomers  - What's the Total Available Market (TAM), The Serviceable Available Market (SAM) and The Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) sub-segment of the market? 
- <b>C</b>ompetitors - This is where Porter's five forces come in handy  
- <b>C</b>ontext - The PESTLE analysis of the product or company.
