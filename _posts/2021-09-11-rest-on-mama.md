excerpt: "R.I.P Mama. I will always love you"

The chill that runs down my spine, the fatigue, the pain...

My heart literally aches, and I just can't explain it. 

I thought I could handle it; nothing could be farther from the truth. 

My only consolation is in your last words. 

I know you're in a better place - free from cancer pain, no more morphine. 

The things you've been through.

You've endured suffering and pain.

No matter what I feel, there's no way I'd want you to go through that again, Mama. 

The heavens have decided, it was time to go yonder. 

Yonder place where the stars are shining so bright. 

Would you please catch a good spot for me, Mama? 

Death seems to be kinder than life. It's such an irony! 

Rest on, Mama. Until we meet again, never to be separated again. 

Much love!
