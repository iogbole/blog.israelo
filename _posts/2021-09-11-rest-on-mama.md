excerpt: "R.I.P Mama, though this brown grave sand of yours only adds colours to my tears"
---

The chill that runs down my spine, the fatigue, the pain...<br>
My heart literally aches, and I just can't explain it. <br>
I thought I could handle it; nothing could be farther from the truth.<br>

My only consolation is in your last words. You were happy and at peace! <br>
I know you're in a better place — free from cancer pain — no more morphine. <br>

The things you've been through.<br>
You've endured suffering and pain.<br>
No matter what I feel, there's no way I'd want you to go through that again, Mama. <br>
The heavens have decided, it was time to go yonder. <br>
Yonder place where the stars are shining so bright! 

Mama, knowing that I can never get a hug from you again is the reason my pillows are soaking wet at dawn.

I collected your grave sand and brought it all the way to the UK.<br> 
I clench your grave sand so hard, hoping it might bring us closer. <br>
<strong>But this brown grave sand of yours only adds colours to my tears, Mama. </strong>

I throw your blanket on me, but it doesn't stop the cold, this chill on my spine; who can help me now? 

Would you please catch a good spot for me, Mama? <br>
<strong>Death seems to be kinder than life. It's such an irony! </strong>

Oh Lord, You've drilled a hole in my heart, and only You can mend it.

Rest on, Mama. Until we meet again, never to be separated again. 

Much love!
