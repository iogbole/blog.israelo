A problem that occurs quite often with new Kubernetes Deployments is that a Service is not working properly.

You have created a Pod through deployment (or other means) and created a Service, but the service is not responding and you're unsure on how to troubleshoot it. 

Try the following steps:

First, ensure that your Pod is up and running, then check the status of the Service: 

```bash
$ kubectl get svc 
NAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
client-api                 ClusterIP   10.43.15.106    <none>        8080/TCP   4h13m
mysqlhost                  ClusterIP   10.43.53.186    <none>        3306/TCP   4h13m
io-infra-agent-service     ClusterIP   10.43.141.226   <none>        9090/TCP   35m
```

Assuming I am interested in the `client-api` service, check if the Service  have endpoints: 

```bash
kubectl get ep client-api 
NAME         ENDPOINTS                                                        AGE
client-api   10.42.0.179:8080,10.42.0.180:8080,10.42.1.119:8080 + 1 more...   4h18m
```

The above result confirms that the endpoints controller has found the correct Pods for the `client-api` Service. If the ENDPOINTS column is `<none>`, you should check that the `spec.selector` field of your Service selects for `metadata.labels` values on your Pods.

At this point, you may want to spin a new (`busybee`) pod to verify connectivity once more. This step should isolate if the problem is with the calling pod. 

```bash
$ kubectl run busybox --image=busybox -it --rm --restart=Never -- wget client-api:8080
Connecting to client-api:8080 (10.43.124.208:8080)
saving to 'index.html'
index.html           100% |********************************|    11  0:00:00 ETA
'index.html' saved
wget: bad address 'configmyapp-demo'
pod "busybox" deleted

```
