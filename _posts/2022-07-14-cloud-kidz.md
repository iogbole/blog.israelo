excerpt: "Watch my kids as they demystify the concepts of cloud computing, cyber security, cyber bullying, etc. I am a proud #GirlDad..."

However, I am slightly biased - I teach them coding and computing - with the hope they fall in love with IT. I described my approach in the <a href="https://www.israelo.io/blog/kids-who-code/" target="_blank">Tips To Get Your Kids Excited About Coding</a> blog post. Check it out! 

It's incredible how fast they understand the concepts. I'd typically have them present what they have learnt to me. This time, I took the pleasure of recording their presentations. 

Watch as my beautiful 9 and 6 year-olds "demystify" (LoL) the concepts of: 

1. The Internet
2. Cloud Computing
3. Cyber Security and 
4. Cyber Bullying. 

Interestingly, there perspectives are slighlty different on each subject. Let's watch!
