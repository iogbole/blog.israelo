I am a proud #GirlDad. We try as much as possible to expose them to other activities such as cooking, ballet, gymnastics, etc., hoping they will eventually find what they would love to do with their lives when they are adults. 

However,  I am slightly biased - I teach them coding and computing - with the hope they fall in love with IT. 

It's incredible how fast they understand the concepts. I'd typically have them present what they have learnt to me. This time, I decided to record their presentations. Watch as my beautiful 9 and 6-year-olds "demystify" (LoL) the concepts of: 

1. The Internet
2. Cloud Computing
3. Cyber Security and 
4. Cyber Bullying. 

Let's watch!
